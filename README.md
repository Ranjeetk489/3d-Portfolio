# Interactive 3D Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my interactive 3D portfolio! This portfolio is a unique blend of creativity and professionalism, showcasing my skills, work experience, and projects in an engaging and interactive manner.

The centerpiece of this portfolio is a 3D model of a floating 'Fox Island'. This island serves as a metaphorical representation of my journey in the tech world, with each element symbolizing a different aspect of my professional life.

A 3D bird flies by the island, symbolizing the freedom and creativity that technology and coding bring. The bird's flight path highlights the various projects and experiences I've accumulated over time.

Adding to the interactivity is a 3D plane that rotates around the island as the user rotates the island, creating a dynamic and immersive user experience.
