## Project Overview

Welcome to my interactive 3D portfolio! This portfolio is a unique blend of creativity and professionalism, showcasing my skills, work experience, and projects in an engaging and interactive manner.

The centerpiece of this portfolio is a 3D model of a floating 'Fox Island'. This island serves as a metaphorical representation of my journey in the tech world, with each element symbolizing a different aspect of my professional life.

A 3D bird flies by the island, symbolizing the freedom and creativity that technology and coding bring.

Adding to the interactivity is a 3D plane that rotates around the island as the user rotates the island, creating a dynamic and immersive user experience.

## Features
